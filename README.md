# Robot 
# This is the Arduino program file for a floorplan mapping autonomous robot. The Arduino acts as a slave device via USB.
# In addition to the Arduino, there is a Raspberry Pi that acts as the master device. 

# The Arduino handles 2 functions: 
# 1. DC motor control via the Adafruit V1 motor shield and
# 2. Tachometry of all 4 wheels implemented with a digital hall sensor
